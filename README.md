A silly little surprise page for someone special. Enter your name, then try to click the button — it keeps dodging your cursor. Chase it down enough times and it finally lets you catch it, setting off fireworks and a sweet message. Names are remembered to personalise the experience between "forever love" and "forever BFF" mode.
